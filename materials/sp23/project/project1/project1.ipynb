Projects submitted fewer than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, and projects submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit. Projects submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.**  For full credit on the checkpoint, you must complete the questions up to the checkpoint, **pass all _public_ autograder tests** for those sections, and submit to the Gradescope Project 1 Checkpoint assignment by **11:00pm PT on Friday, 2/17**. <span style=\"color: #BC412B\">**The checkpoint is worth 5% of your entire project grade**</span>. After you've submitted the checkpoint, you may still change your project answers before the final project deadline - only your final submission, to the \"Project 1\" assignment, will be graded for correctness. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",

On Gradescope, the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.** Once you submit, click into your submission, and there will be an option to Add Group Member in the top right corner. You may also reference [this walkthrough video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1POtij6KECSBjCUeOC_F0Lt3ZmKN7LKIq/view?usp=sharing) on how to add partners on Gradescope.\n",

Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",

However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!

To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in Question 1 of the Global Poverty section we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`. Do not reassign the variable name `latest` to anything else in your notebook, otherwise there is the chance that our tests grade against what `latest` was reassigned to.\n",

    "**Question 11.** Create a function `stats_for_year` that takes a `year` and returns a table of statistics. The table it returns should have four columns: `geo`, `population_total`, `children_per_woman_total_fertility`, and `child_mortality_under_5_per_1000_born`. Each row should contain one unique Alpha-3 country code and three statistics: population, fertility rate, and child mortality for that `year` from the `population`, `fertility` and `child_mortality` tables. Only include rows for which all three statistics are available for the country and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, restrict the result to country codes that appears in `big_50`, an array of the 50 most populous countries in 2020. This restriction will speed up computations later in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you write `stats_for_year`, try calling `stats_for_year` on any year between 1960 and 2020. Try to understand the output of stats_for_year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: The tests for this question are quite comprehensive, so if you pass the tests, your function is probably correct. However, without calling your function yourself and looking at the output, it will be very difficult to understand any problems you have, so try your best to write the function correctly and check that it works before you rely on the `grader` tests to confirm your work.\n",

    "**Question 12.** Create a table called `pop_by_decade` with two columns called `decade` and `population`, in this order. It has a row for each year that starts a decade, in increasing order starting with 1960 and ending with 2020. For example, 1960 is the start of the 1960's decade. The `population` column contains the total population of all countries included in the result of `stats_for_year(year)` for the first `year` of the decade. You should see that these countries contain most of the world's population.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* One approach is to define a function `pop_for_year` that computes this total population, then `apply` it to the `decade` column.  **Think about how you can use the `stats_for_year` function** from the previous question if you want to implement `pop_for_year`.\n",

It should draw a line plot of the number of people living in poverty in that country with time on the horizontal axis. The line plot should have a point for each row in the `poverty` table for that country. To compute the population living in poverty from a poverty percentage, multiply by the population of the country **in that year**.\n",
